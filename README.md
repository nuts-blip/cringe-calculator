# Cringe Calculator 

Welcome to **Cringe Calculator**, a fun and unique twist on a basic calculator for Scrapyard Seattle! This project combines math, randomness, and a sprinkle of personality to turn ordinary calculations into an entertaining experience.

## About the Project

Quirky Calculator is not your everyday calculator. Here's what makes it special:
- If the answer to your math problem is **10 or above**, the calculator surprises you with a **random number** instead!
- Ask too many questions, and the calculator gets really angry and roasts you.

This was my beginner-level project, and I had a long but fun time coding it, debugging issues, and learning throughout the entire process.

## Features

- Basic math calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Random number generator for answers **10 or higher**.
- An interactive and sassy response system when too many inputs are entered.

## Process of how it works

1. Input a math problem (e.g., `5 + 5` or `6 * 2`).
2. If the result is below 10, the correct answer is displayed.
3. If the result is **10 or higher**, the calculator generates a **random number** instead.
4. Ask too many questions, and watch out for some funny **grumpy responses** from the calculator.

## Tech stack

This project was built using:
- I used python! First time ever.

## I learned

During this project, I learned:
- How to implement conditional logic in programming.
- Debugging skills to fix unexpected issues in my code.
- The importance of user interaction in making a program more engaging.
- Reaching out to mentors and other attendees for help

## Thanks!
Thanks to Hack Club and Seattle Scrapyard for this!
